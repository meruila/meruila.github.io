Hello, I am Mira! I am software developer with a background in bioinformatics and data analysis. Previously, I taught introductory programming, digital logic circuits, database systems, and software engineering at UP Los Baños, where I also took my bachelors.

Prior to this, I was a student researcher at the Philippine Genome Center - Program for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Forestry under the Tawilis Multi-omics Project and the Wang Computational Biology Lab in Michigan State University.
